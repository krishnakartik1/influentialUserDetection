# influentialUserDetection
Determines the influence of a twitter user by calculating the user's spread of communication with the help of retweets.

`twitterCheck.py` - I used this initially to check whether the connection with the api was successfull. This file is also responsible for collecting the user dataset, given a seed user and storing it in twitteridsnew.txt.

`getUserInfluence.py` - This is the main file that calculates the influence of the users given in twitteridsnew.txt. 

`twitteridsComplete2.txt` - This is a redundant text file with the initial contents of twitteridsnew.txt.
